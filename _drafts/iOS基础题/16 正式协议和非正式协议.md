## 正式协议和非正式协议

### 原文解释
Formal and Informal Protocols

There are two varieties of protocol, formal and informal:

> An informal protocol is a category on NSObject, which implicitly makes almost all objects adopters of the protocol. (A category is a language feature that enables you to add methods to a class without subclassing it.) Implementation of the methods in an informal protocol is optional. Before invoking a method, the calling object checks to see whether the target object implements it. Until optional protocol methods were introduced in Objective-C 2.0, informal protocols were essential to the way Foundation and AppKit classes implemented delegation.

> A formal protocol declares a list of methods that client classes are expected to implement. Formal protocols have their own declaration, adoption, and type-checking syntax. You can designate methods whose implementation is required or optional with the @required and @optional keywords. Subclasses inherit formal protocols adopted by their ancestors. A formal protocol can also adopt other protocols.
Formal protocols are an extension to the Objective-C language.


### 简单解释：


### 翻译
> 非正式协议：非正式协议是NSObject的一个类别Category，几乎所有的对象都隐含的采用（类别是OC的语言特性，能够给类对象添加方法而不需要创建子类），非正式协议的方法是可选的

> 正式协议： 一个正式协议声明了类需要实现的方法列表，正式协议有自己的声明、采用和类型检查语法。你可以使用@required或者optional关键字指定方法是否必须实现。子类继承父类采用的协议。正式协议也可以遵守其他协议
